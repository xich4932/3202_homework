    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This practicum is due on Moodle by **11:59 PM on Sunday December 12**.  Your solutions to theoretical questions should be done in Markdown/LateX directly below the associated question. Your solutions to computational questions should include any relevant Python code, as well as results and any written commentary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The rules:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose any TWO of the following three problems to submit. Note the problems that you are submitting below. If you do not choose two problems, the graders will grade the first 2 problems by default. The graders WILL NOT grade all three problems and pick the 2 highest scores. So it is your responsibility to clearly indicate the TWO problems you are choosing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**I choose Problem X1 and Problem X2**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All work, code and analysis must be **your own**.\n",
    "1. You may use your course notes, posted lecture slides, textbook, in-class notebooks and homework solutions as resources.  You may also search online for answers to general knowledge questions, like the form of a probability distribution function, or how to perform a particular operation in Python.\n",
    "1. You may **not** post to message boards or other online resources asking for help.\n",
    "1. **You may not collaborate with classmates or anyone else.**\n",
    "1. This is meant to be like a coding portion of your final exam. So, I will be much less helpful than I typically am with homework. For example, I will not check answers, help debug your code, and so on.\n",
    "1. If you have a question, post it first as a **private** Piazza message. If I decide that it is appropriate for the entire class, then I will make it a public post (and anonymous).\n",
    "1. If something is left open-ended, it is probably because I intend for you to code it up however you want, and only care about the plots/analysis I see at the end. Feel free to ask clarifying questions though.\n",
    "\n",
    "Violation of these rules will result in an **F** and a trip to the Honor Code council.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**By writing your name below, you agree to abide by these rules:**\n",

Each state is a 1 unit cube. So when $L=2$ (for example), there are cubes centered at each $x=0,1,2$, $y=0,1,2$ and so on, for a total state space size of $3^3 = 27$ states.\n",
